Then you can create 2 groups A and B, then use characters and traits only in the matching groups. As long as you rename both traits “A1” and “B1” back to “1”, they will be merged in your final generation results, thus not messing with the rarity calculations.

Public sales are open to all wallet addresses. When the demand is higher the rest of the supply after allowlist presale, some NFT traders might use bots or rise up the gas to speed up the minting speed to make sure they can get one. This, sometime, causes what we call “gas war”.","Publicsale-intro-2-1":"Time point when all addresses can start to mint publicly. Normally starts after the allowlist presale phase ends.","Publicsale-intro-3-1":"An ending time is optional.
