# Why you need to use CloseSky to trade NFT?
We are a group of people who love NFT and in our constant trading, we have discovered that one of the huge problems of the NFT market is the huge and unbelievably high fees. Generally, project issuers get 5%-10% transaction fees and Opensea charges 2.5% fees, which makes the cost of trading NFT per trade incredibly high.

The key problem is that whether you make money or not, even if you sell your NFT at a loss you will have to pay the same percentage of fees to the project issuer. Ask myself, do I have to pay a fee to Tesla when I sell a used Tesla?

That obviously doesn't make sense. Not only that, but in the real world, you buy a painting and you own it, but in the blockchain world you actually have to pay the issuer for each transaction? This way we are the ones who lose money every time, but the issuer gets the revenue without any risk forever.

To break this thing. We created CloseSky, an NFT trading platform, with the goal of lowering NFT transaction fees. So we proposed a trading model of 0 royalty + 1% commission. Let NFT enthusiasts really own NFT (really own all NFT).

To be credible, we open source our trading contract, so you can see the contract source code at Etherscan.

Secondly we also know that a new platform is difficult to have enough buyers for NFT at first, so we propose a way to trade off-site in Discord, you can list your order in CloseSky, then post the listing address to Discord, if someone sees your NFT, then you can complete the transaction safely through CloseSky, which is a very safe way for both buyers and sellers, while we charge 1% transaction fee.

Later on we will airdrop our trading NFT membership card to users who join us early. Especially for those who have generated some blue chip NFT trades in our platform.

Fuck Royalty,Enjoy CloseSky!
