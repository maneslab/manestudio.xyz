### FAQ

#### 1. When will the revenue arrive?

We use smart contracts for revenue distribution, when a user mint, you will get ETH revenue in your login wallet address in real time with 0 delay.


#### 2. How do I get the transaction royalty?

After our current royalty settings, we need to wait until our trading platform is online before we can start using it; simply put, we will provide a trading platform to trade NFT membership cards, and when users trade on it, your set royalty percentage will be deposited to your wallet account, which will also be in real time, and is expected to be online within 1-2 months.

However, you can create your collection in opensea now and set opensea royalties to get your royalty draw on opensea transactions
